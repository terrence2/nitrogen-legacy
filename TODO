DONE Get UFO motion working.
DONE Tie the terrain POI back to the camera.
DONE Draw tris as solid strips.
DONE Allow speed control of the UFO with the mouse wheel.
DONE Figure out if we need to move to abstract units for this. Is there a way
     we can test precision over the range we need? Yes, see comments in terrain.h.
Enable and use diffuse lighting; compress day/night for better effect. 
Ensure terrain detail level joins are working. Employ the POI and lighting for this.
Apply a colormap. Create the code to load store and manage diffuse color textures.
Create controls for adjusting a fractal brownian heightmap and use it to get reasonable terrain.
  * We have to do both color and heights at the same time to get reasonable results.
  * This is not the final pass, it just has to look good enough to let us work on the atmosphere.
Create the skybox: it's full of stars.
Draw an atmosphere.
  * Ensure it looks good at all times and from all altitudes and space.
  * Do not forget that the atmosphere has to light the ground (and other objects?) as well, so we
    need the terrain fragment shader to do some work here too.
(optional) Do a second pass at the terrain. Give some attention to each biome at 1000 to 50000 feet.
Draw a water plane and do some basic per-pixel water.
  * Focus on specular at first.
  * Maybe use motion across 3D simplex space to simulate waves?
  * Or maybe just simulate water?
Load up blender and see if we can figure out how to model and paint some basic airport structures.
Once the model toolchain is up, try to get a cessna model in game.
Implement a basic Saint's Row style flight engine. We'll need this for AI in any case, if not for the player.
Make a wind tunnel.
Develop an actual realtime fluid-based flight model around "simple" planes with no computer.
